# SAPUI5 Application Best Practices with CRUD support in SAP Web IDE

The purpose for this repository is to get you quickly up and running with the "Application Best Practices" guide from SAPUI5/OpenUI5 with fully CRUD support connected to the Northwind OData Service via the HCP destination service.

The repository is an extract from the tdg folder from the OpenUI5 repository: src/sap.m/test/sap/m/demokit/tdg
https://github.com/SAP/openui5

The application uses the CRUD-able Northwind OData Service for CREATE and READ.

To quickly get the best practice application up and running:

* Grab the zip file this repository and import it into the SAP Web IDE
* Import the "north" file which is also contained in this repository into the destination in the HCP account cockpit

## Changelog
* 8th March 2015: I created a very simple UPDATE operation, maybe not most elegant, but functional, merge setting is very important
